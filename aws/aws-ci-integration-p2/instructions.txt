Continuous Integration Process:
Code should be build and test everytime there is a commit. This is CI. If there is a manual build in place, this will not be possible.

Server Approach: Manual overhead and time consuming.
Cloud Services: Set up AWS CI Pipeline. Short MTTR (Mean Time To Repair), AGILE, No OPs, No Human Intervention

AWS Tools:
- Code Commmit (Version Control System)
- Code Artifact (Maven Repo for Dependencies)
- Code Build (Build Sservice from AWS)
- Code Deploy (Artifact Deloyment Service)

- SonarCloud  (Sonarqube Cloud Services)
- Checkstyle (Code Analysis from Build Job)
- Code Pipeline (Service to Integrate all jobs together)

Architecture AWS Pipeline:
Source --> Review --> Build

Source: (AWS Code Commit) --> Review: (AWS CodeBuild - Pull Dependencies from AWS CodeArtifact) <-> SonarCloud --> Build (AWS CodeBuild - Pulls Dependencies from AWS CodeArtifact) --> AWS S3 Bucket (Artifact Storage)

Step 1: Code Commit Setup
- Create CodeCommit Repo:
    - Create Maven repository - vprofile-code-repo
- IAM User with custom policies for CC - one to one access to CC
    - In IAM, create user- vprofile-code-admin - Add policy and create new custom policy. Give all CodeCommit rights. 
    - Select Specify ARN, and select Account, your region (us-east-2), repo name you created earlier.
    - Give policy name: vprofile-repo-fullaccess
    - Go back to previous tab, search for the newly created policy and click add. user is created now. 
    - Create access key for this user under Security Credentials. Save the CSV file with all the info. 
    - Make sure to have aws cli, run aws --Version
    - run aws configure and add your access id and access key here
- SSH auth to CodeCommit Repo from our local machine:
    - Create a SSH key. ssh-keygen and use the name vpro-codecommit_rsa
    - Upload public key to the AWS User we just created. 
    - Now we will need to create a config file that basically says to use the private key when the public key is being used during authentication
    
- Migrate vProfile repo from Github to codecommit. Clone to our PC and then upload to CodeCommit repo
