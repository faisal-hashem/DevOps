- Re-create: Deletes all existing pods and re-creates new pods

- Rolling Update: Takes down maximum number listed number of pods one at a time and deploys new upgraded pods

- Blue/Green: Deploy new deployment with v2 tag. Update the service yaml to selector tag v2 once confirmeed v2 is working

- Canary: Deploy new deployment with a new tag, once validate its working. Add a new tag across both deployments so service traffic
          routes to both deployments. And do some math to figure out the percentage of users you want to have the new deployments.
          Once confirmed, create that certain number of pods in the new deployment(canary) and test.
          Once confirmed no issues across the board. Update the pod number to include more pods and eventually to 100%.
          Istio allows you to route by percentage regardless of the number of pods
